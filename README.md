## Hi there, I'm Jina 👋

I'm a Computer Science student pursuing my second bachelor's degree at the Unviersity of British Columbia! I initially graduated with a degree in Medical Laboratory Sciences where I learned about human pathology. I then joined the Canadian military as a Combat Medic and worked as a police dispatcher on the civilian side for the Vancouver Police Department. In these roles, I noticed several deficiencies in SOPs and technology. Often, these dire shortfalls critically impaired emergency response, endangering both public safety and officer effectiveness.

It's in this enviornment my passion for streamlining inefficient processes fostered. Eventually, my passion led me to return to school to pursue my second-degree in Computer Sciences.
Although I just started last year, I've made strides to equip myself with the skills I need to start tackling some of these inefficiences that plague not only the emergency services sector, but also every day life. 

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:
